# Python-RegEx-Examples

This repository showcases various functionalities of the built-in re module in Python for regular expression matching and manipulation.

## What is the re Module?
The re module provides powerful tools for working with regular expressions in Python. Regular expressions are text patterns that allow you to match, search, and manipulate strings based on specific rules.

## Features
This repository demonstrates the following functionalities of the re module:

### Matching:
Check if a string matches a specific pattern.
Extract substrings that match the pattern.

### Searching:
Find all occurrences of a pattern within a string.
Replace matched patterns with a different string.
Character Classes and Metacharacters:
Utilize special characters like . (any character), * (zero or more repetitions), etc.
Define character classes for specific character sets.
Grouping and Backreferences:
Capture parts of the matched pattern for later use.
Use captured groups within the pattern itself.

## Examples
The repository includes Python scripts demonstrating various use cases of the re module. These scripts cover tasks like:

Validating email addresses
Extracting phone numbers from text
Finding specific words or patterns in a string
Replacing text with alternative content

## Getting Started
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Ahmed9588406/Python-RegEx-Examples.git
Open the example scripts in your preferred Python IDE.
Run the scripts to see them in action.
Note: The example scripts will include comments and explanations to guide you through the code.
